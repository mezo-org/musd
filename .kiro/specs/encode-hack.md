# Encode Mezo Hackathon
## This hackathon explores self-service banking on Bitcoin rails, all powered by Mezo.
### Mezo enables users to borrow MUSD against Bitcoin collateral at 1% fixed rates, maintaining full control over their positions. Users can close positions whenever they want, add collateral as needed, and deploy their MUSD across DeFi to earn yield that covers their borrowing costs.

The model is simple: Bitcoin holders deposit BTC as collateral, mint MUSD (a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin), and use it for spending or yield generation while keeping their Bitcoin exposure. Everything happens onchain and transparently - users can audit positions, track collateral ratios, and manage their own risk. 

Mezo helps transform Bitcoin from static holdings into productive capital without requiring users to sell or trust intermediaries.

## Requirements:
- Your project must integrate MUSD
- You must deploy working demo on testnet
- Your project must be developed during the hackathon (original work) or present a completely new approach to an existing project
- KYB needed for prize distribution
- All Mezo incentives are tied to milestones and are conditional on being live on Mezo or ETH mainnet
